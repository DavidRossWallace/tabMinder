# tabMinder
Generates and manages dynamic html tab sets

I use tabMinder to generate and manage mutliple levels of dynamic tabs for the everyMind interface: https://github.com/DavidRossWallace/everymind

everyMind can load any number of "mindsets," and each mindset has a set of tabs to work with and explore the data. tabMinder made it easy to dynanically generate, populate and dynamically control the tabs and content panes.

Tha tabMinder includes functions to create, alter, click and destroy tabs, as well as functions to easly swap out tab pane content without having to remember element ids.
